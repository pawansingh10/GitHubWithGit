## 1. Introduction to GitHub
We have already seen **Git**, Again we're discussing **GitHub**. Aren't they sound very similar?

It seems like Git and GitHub both are same thing But NOOOOOOOOOO!

Git and GitHub are completely two different thing. Although they support each other like two brothers.

So, Let's understand the difference between Git and GitHub.

- **Git VS GitHub**

  1. Git is a distributed VCS, VCS is a software that manages or keeps  track of files and folders in your project.
  2. Git is a most popular version control system. There are other VCS as well like Subversion, Mercurial etc etc.
  3. We use git bcuz it is a distributed Version control system.
  
> **Git** is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.

  4. GitHub is not a version control system. It is a website(Cloud based hosting website). Basically It is a service that allows you to host Git Repository .

> **GitHub** is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories
    
> If you want to work with opensource projects that use **Git**, then **GitHub** is designed to help you better manage them.
 
  5. If you have a project on Git and you want to take that project and upload somewhere on the cloud/server so that everyone can see all around the world. you can make that project as public. So what you do is take your Git project and upload it on GitHub.
  
  - So, GitHub is like social Networking Website for developer community like Facebook or LinkedIn where developers from all around the world can come and work on one project. Similar to facebook where users or friends they can chats, they can create a groups.

Let say If you want to create a mobile Application a machine learning app. or a machine learning app or a web app and you want that other collaborators/developers should also contribute to it. So what you can do is you can opensource this project or this software, whatever you are creating. And If you're using git as a version control then you can host that project on GitHub.

It's not that GitHub is only one platform, Similar to Git, we also have SVN, Mercurial, different-2 vcs.

> **GitHub can be also used as a portfolio to show that you are an active developer**
Example - If you show that I have a lot of projects on my GitHub Repository then a lot of recruites actually visit your profile to see that your contribution in projects or opensource project.And Many recruiters hire developers from GitHub as well.

**Only developers can undersatnd HOW IMPORTANT GITHUB IS?**
