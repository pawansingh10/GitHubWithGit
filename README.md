## 1. Introduction to GitHub
We have already seen **Git**, Again we're discussing **GitHub**. Aren't they sound very similar?

It seems like Git and GitHub both are same thing But NOOOOOOOOOO!

Git and GitHub are completely two different thing. Although they support each other like two brothers.

So, Let's understand the difference between Git and GitHub.

- **Git VS GitHub**

  1. Git is a distributed VCS, VCS is a software that manages or keeps  track of files and folders in your project.
  2. Git is a most popular version control system. There are other VCS as well like Subversion, Mercurial etc etc.
  3. We use git bcuz it is a distributed Version control system.
  
> **Git** is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.

  4. GitHub is not a version control system. It is a website(Cloud based hosting website). Basically It is a service that allows you to host Git Repository .

> **GitHub** is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories
    
> If you want to work with opensource projects that use **Git**, then **GitHub** is designed to help you better manage them.
 
  5. If you have a project on Git and you want to take that project and upload somewhere on the cloud/server so that everyone can see all around the world. you can make that project as public. So what you do is take your Git project and upload it on GitHub.
  
  - So, GitHub is like social Networking Website for developer community like Facebook or LinkedIn where developers from all around the world can come and work on one project. Similar to facebook where users or friends they can chats, they can create a groups.

Let say If you want to create a mobile Application a machine learning app. or a machine learning app or a web app and you want that other collaborators/developers should also contribute to it. So what you can do is you can opensource this project or this software, whatever you are creating. And If you're using git as a version control then you can host that project on GitHub.

It's not that GitHub is only one platform, Similar to Git, we also have SVN, Mercurial, different-2 vcs.

Similar to GitHub we have other platform as well one is BitBucket, GitLab, Sourceforge, launchapd etc.

> **GitHub can be also used as a portfolio to show that you are an active developer**

Example - If you show that I have a lot of projects on my GitHub Repository then a lot of recruites actually visit your profile to see that your contribution in projects or opensource project.And Many recruiters hire developers from GitHub as well.

**Only developers can undersatnd HOW IMPORTANT GITHUB IS?**

**Git and GitHub, They both although sound same, they are support each other But they're not same exactly.**


Let's explore Git as a website.
1. Search in google [GitHub]
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7deb0458-457c-44e5-8047-a483e1ab1008)

5. If you have an account on GitHub earlier, Simply Sign In by sing your Username/Email and Password
6. Once you're Sign in on GitHub Website, You will be landing on GitHub Home Page or you can say DashBoard of GitHub
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/891bfd57-e18c-4639-b2bd-667bc72138d1)

7. You'll see repository, repository is like your folder or project
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae0087d3-5b7b-475d-8ffd-ded1260700f4)
8. You'll see all activities things related to your followings and changes you made recently
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5901c89e-235c-41ff-bb9e-31983b0d75a7)
9. You can see your Profile, there yoy can see your repositories/projects and contribution or commit graphs(green dot box) and all stuffs
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bc6f138-65fd-49de-ab88-2ab2d318937a)
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d37d8e5f-c465-4437-9d54-a981771ad1e6)

10. Basically you should explore all the sections out there!!

- **How to create a new repository/import repository/**, Simply left of your profile there will be + sign button
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ce68d23-3299-4b18-8e63-73b4d3c73ffb)

### How do we create Central Repository?
- Before that Let's understand **Why Central Repository is required?**
- Everyone knows in Git, there are 3 stages 1> Working Directory 2> Staging Area 3> Local Repo Commits, all these three things are on your local system.
  So suppose Developer 1 has its Git project on his local machine, similarly another Developer 2 has also his on Git Project on his local machine.
  If Developer 1 wants to work on a project on its own, only one person Developer 1, Then Developer 1 can use Git in his local System that's perfectly fine. Similar is true for Developer 2 also.

  But What if Developer 1 and Developer 2 and more n Developers wants to contribute or work on a single project.Then they need something called **Server or central Repository**.
  This Central repository will contain the final code that everyone can see, push or pull who is working on that project.
  So Developer 2 will see there are some changes over here on central repository then I need to pull the code.
  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b38ce7a4-03ad-4c51-9294-2f942f5f00ac)

 - Let's see **How do we create Central Repository?**
   1. Open GitHub Log in & you'll land on GitHub Home Page, there will be + sign button click you will see dropdown list there you will find New Repository option.
      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f54bda06-4800-4178-81c4-7968b18311b3)

      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f768d52-f715-4a52-b53b-9fcb487009ee)


   2. As you create a New Repository, You will get a pop and option like this to create a new repository on the Command line
      ```shell
         echo "# GitHub101" >> README.md
         git init
         git add README.md
         git commit -m "first commit"
         git branch -M main
         git remote add origin git@github.com:pawansingh10/GitHub101.git
         git push -u origin main
      ```
     
      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ce7e2db-e530-46d8-b19c-f3f673cc48a1)
  
      Creating README.md & Adding README.md to staging area
      Creating Main Branch as Master Slave Concept is now not recommendable for Git, So basically renaming it to Main Branch + Checking the Branch Details which we have created
      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01dbd03f-82f8-4728-ab8e-b86a0b6efb51)
 
      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20dcd502-28a9-47d4-b73b-fdb73ff45941)
  
      Setting GitHub Repository path to our Local Git
      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8e344b4-a127-47ea-9336-d7c2670adf85)
  
      Setting URL of your GitHub Repository if permissed denied without https path.
      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0873d312-04b5-49fd-af56-08962af61d30)

      Pushing you data from your local git repository to GitHub server main branch repository, for the first time
      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae751282-2058-4715-8c25-ec9d87f231b1)

      Now you will see on your Git-GitHub Repository the README.md file will be uploaded into your repository

      Next Let's create one more file intro.txt but your intro save this on your local git repository
      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c96986d-9d24-4ef0-b75a-25fc6b183ce3)

      Now pushing it to your Server GitHub Repository
      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50b9d225-e171-4a39-abd1-3c95a055c7c6)

      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bafd1c25-d506-481f-9a0e-f6d004077172)

- **Token Authentication Error**
Whever you have to push your code to the GitHub Repository or Central Repository. So you have to authenticate yourself that This is my User_ID and Password.
Once GitHub authenticate that you're a real user, then it allows you to push/pull or whatever you want to do on GitHub?
For Authentication there are 3 ways:-
1. **User_ID and Password**, Problem with User_ID and password is it's less secure.So Now GitHub does support this after 2021, instead they came with PAT
2. **PAT - Personal Access Token**, These are token based authentication
3. **SSH**, This is more secure

So Without TAP or SSH Authentication, You won't be able to push your code to GitHub, bcuz GitHud doesn't support User_ID, Password. 

### PAT Personal Access Token Authentication

Let's see **How do we Authentication with Personal Access Token?** or How to create the Personal Access Token?
- Open GitHub Account >> Got to Profile >> Setting >> Developer Setting >> Personal Access Token >> Generate a new Token
  You can write 1. Note as Demo or for what purpose, Put 2. Expiry Date - No Expiry 3. Select Scope - Repository blah blah So Create for Everything  >> Generate token 


  Once you have PAT, Setup it with Windows Credential Manager for that >> Control Panel > Search for Windows Credential > Search GitHub replace your password with PAToken.

  PAT works over the https, so if your repository is in https they you can use PAT.
  But you have created repository on SSH, in that case you have to use SSH Key

### SSH Authentication
  Lets see **SSH Key Authentication**
  SSH (Secure Shell Protocol) and they're more secure than PAT(HTTPS) and hhtps

  **Generate New SSH Key, and How to authenticate yourself with SSH Key?**
  [Click Here for Official Doc](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys)

  Generate New SSH Key
  ```shell
      ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
  ```
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b86ea38-271d-41cc-88bc-cdcfbddd80f6)

  It says generating public and private keys. There will be always Two keys 1> Private Key 2> Public Key when you work with SSH as there are different algorithms behind each key generated.
  The Private Key is always remain in your local computer or system.
  The Public Key, you will have to put on GitHub.
  There is no two way encryption like if someone get your Public Key, they will not be able to get private key from the public key

  > Whenever you try to authenticate or push your code to GitHub, Now you don't have to put the password this is why we are using SSH Key.
  > Whenever you do operation on GitHUb that require authentication the what Git and GitHub will do is they will check private key with public key of your GitHub account if they match they will authenticate you to do operation if it doesn't match It will fail to authenticate.That's why SSh Key is generate in Key-Pair.

  It is asking you for file name to store SSH Key, Simply type enter it will take that default file name which is mentioned there like **id_ed234xxxx**
  Again it will ask for pass phrase, if you don't want hit enter and move forward

  Your SSH is generate
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc51dce8-8757-4db0-960c-e2e883370516)

  Your Private and Public key is generate in the mentioned Hidden Folders
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92e13489-5709-4eed-9e89-83393b084902)

 Copy your public key which is having extension .pub open that in any editor and copy the key and Now we have to put that public key onto our GitHub Account
 Go to GitHub >> Profile >> Setting >> SSH and GPG Keys >> SSH Key >> New SSH Key >> Give Title like Demo and Paste key in Key section >> Add SSH Key

 Now your SSH Key has been added to your GitHub account now whenever you need to authenticate you just simply perform the operations
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4498f1df-baac-4e07-a999-246d972c9560)

If you want to check your SSH keys set properly or not, Try this out
```shell
   ssh -T git@github.com
```
☝️Use the above command to connect Git with GitHub Server, This will take your GitHub account and try to authenticate

This means your SSH Key is enables as you're seeing your username.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6af9345-1e67-4058-9463-cbf8ef60bf0d)

> Most of the time people use SSH to authenticate bcuz It is more secure but again that's fine you don't want to use SSH even if you use Personal Access Token that's okay But again after 2021 you can't use UserID and Password to authenticate.


[You can read more about the token Authentication Click Here](https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/)

[To remember the Personal Access token in your laptop for future authentication, follow the steps](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68775869/support-for-password-authentication-was-removed-please-use-a-personal-access-to)

[To read more about SSH Keys, read the Github official docs.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

### Uploading an existing Git Project on GitHub
- We have one project called MyPortfolio, We have seen how to create new repository on central server GitHub and also sink the repository with Git on local Machine.
- So we have alo to changes and commits to our local Git Repository
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3ed4e39-800e-411d-874e-fa79db2c267b)
- Now we want to keep this project as it is and want to push this project / these codes and with all commits which are being made on the central Repository GitHub the How can we do this?

  Step 1. Create a new Repository on GitHub with name MyPortfolio it is not neccessarily same as local repository, Description can be My Personal Website, keep it as public, Create Repository
          Then you will see another option push an existing repository from command line
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cf44dbe-754b-42ee-8ded-57bb742ec8d7)

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03a2f666-cf89-4f35-887f-63e45c1abdb8)

  Step 2. The only thing we have to do is add the remote of this GitHub server repository by using command
          If you check Remote, So there is no remote
  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/caadeccd-7fff-452d-8881-98e953fbf9d2)

  So let's add the remote 
  ```shell
          git remote add origin https://github.com/pawansingh10/MyPortfolio.git
          git branch -M main
          git push -u origin main
  ```
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9753bf60-de2a-424d-a8a7-d323a80c97ce)

     After this if you want to rename your master branch to main write the command then you can do if you wish other let it be
     Now you have to push your master branch to GitHub repository which is central repository.

     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/799e378a-dbfe-4c3b-a9b9-ebccf519d104)
        ☝️ It has created a new branch master from local git master branch  to the master of GitHub Repository
             All files and folders transfer is done and there in link given you can check there
             So refresh you GitHub repository you will see all files and folder there.

   So if you share this url to anyone they can see your files and folder.

  You can check all the commits you have been made since the starting from your local git.

  Here, you're not seeing **README.md** file. It tells to viewers that This Project is all about this........Documentation.
  So Let's add README.md file and push it to GitHub repository
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cdb945a-ae35-43a6-bfad-fed9178d1e21)

**Summary - This is how create a project on GitHub, with new project or already existing git project**

### Working with Remotes
Let's see What is Remote?
Remote in Git or GitHub is exactly like a remote of a TV/AC/Device. What actually remote does is Control comething from a different location.
That's why we added ```bash git remote add origin <url of project>``` which means -
To check How many remotes are available ```bash git remote ``` you will see only one which is origin
So here **Origin** is a remote name, by suing this remote you can push and pull to any particular repository

For see details about remote ```bash git remote -v```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/810d449c-297d-4f6c-98de-5f8505b64fed)
☝️ You'll see two links one is for fetch which means this link can be use to fetch the files and folder from GitHub to your local Git repository
   another one is for push which means this link can be use to push the files and folder from your local Git repository to Central GitHub repository
   So One remote can be use to push something and fetch something at the same time

But what if I don't want to name it as origin? can We add one more remote? Yes We can. for that instead of origin keep you remote name as myremote
```shell git remote add myremote <url https://github.com/abc10>```

So Let's add one remote
```shell git add remote myremote <url project repo link>```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0f28afe-6d91-4600-9657-8ccff80890d2)

If we have to push something last time what we did was ```shell git push -u origin master``` , Here -u was to say this is a upstream.

We have 2 ways to push/fetch our code to Central GitHub repository through you remote one through origin another through myremote it doesn't matter
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83b1338a-a365-4b6e-a32a-6a5d66ef568f)

### Cloning a GitHub Repository
- Here, We will see How to clone any GitHub Repository

- So first go to the your GitHub Home Page, Search for the Repository you want to clone in search bar.
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5099112c-bbe8-4fc7-b454-24db6e8420ee)
- Click on that project/repo, you will get two options either you can download a zip file in GUI way or by copy the http link of the repo through command line.
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/402445a1-41ac-465d-9705-59859ae7734f)
- Obviously we will do it by Git Bash Command line, first move to your folder where you want to clone/download then run the cmd ```shell git clone <url of GitHUb Repository>```
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f87c7252-c9f5-446c-81e5-1ab9f021bc6e)
- Now you can make changes in the file and play around these make commits and all but all on your local Git Repository.
- If you want to make changes or contribute to the other you can't do it here. We will see that in next section.
**Summary, We have seen how to clone a repository**

So We're done with GitHub basics, we will see advance topic in next section

## 2. Social Coding with GitHub

Here in this section, we will deep dive into GitHub, 
- How can we collaborate with other developer's projects?
- How can we create a network of developers?
- other features related to GitHub

### Fetching Changes from GitHub
How do you take changes, whatever the changes that has been done or uploaded by other developers in any project/repository/code?
So How can we download those changes?
One thing we can do is clone the repository again and again but a repository every time will download the complete repository.
So Here we can do that by **git fetch**

The ```shell git fetch``` command downloads commits, files and refs from a remote repository into your loca repo
Although if you have different branches on GitHub so you can specify from which branch you want to take changes ```shell git fetch <remote> <branch>```

So ```shell git fetch``` can take those changes from GitHub Server repository to your local repository not in working Directory or staging area.
There is one more command after **git fetch** that we have to do to take those changes and to reflect it in our local working directory ```shell git ```

So Let say if some other developer is contributing to your project and he added a new file newdeveloper.html there and you  want to fetch the file into local Git Repository
Now I want to keep my local git repository up to date as a synchronisation.

So If you check what are your remotes, remotes are like this local repository is connected with a central GitHub repository with a remote.
```shell git remote -v ``
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a61166a-3429-46e4-8e0f-050d7abbcb3e)
We have 2 remotes origin and myremote both are referencing or pointing to the same central repository which is our GitHub Repository. So we can use any of them.

Now, ```shell git fetch ``` will be fine if you have only one branch which is in this case that is master branch But if you have multiple branches over there on your central repository in that case you have to specify from which branch and by which remote you want to fetch ```shell git fetch origin master```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/772c51c8-5077-41f1-a0bd-1d173569cc17) ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a7edec5-a8d8-4d36-a4ed-de398e8904b7)

So the last commit from Central GitHub Server Repository  master branch has been downloaded to your local git repository, but you will not see that commit into your local git working directory that's bcuz git fetch only do chnages from central server to local git repository there is one more step if you want to see the changes into your local working directory is ```shell git merge <remote><branch>```.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/175dc7bb-316a-4fcc-8347-cdb2243aafb1)

If you want to delete the extra remote which you had created then write command ```shell git remote remove <remote_name>```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6306ba64-9b26-414a-b85f-177d090dc66d)

### Pulling changes from GitHub
Similar to ```shell git fetch``` there is also a commad called ```shell git pull``` 
Que : What's the difference between ```shell git fetch``` and ```shell git pull```?
Ans - To overcome the two commands ```shell git fetch origin master``` and  ```shell git merge <remote><branch>```, git pull found helpful in just one command ```shell git pull```
     git pull takes changes from central server repository to directy local git working directory. 

> **git pull = git fetch + git merge**
> There is disadvantage also.

Now suppose another developer added files to central github repository and made commits now you want to pull it So lets see how we can do it by git pull instead of git fetch like last time
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a010c431-73bf-473c-9c66-76cb30defdf9)

One Question will arise, Out of git fetch and git pull which one should be preferred?
It's up you, if you're working on alone no other collaborator then you can use git pull but some time if you use git pull there can be issue of merge conflicts(when the same file is changed by two different branch/developers and they try to merge them)
So safer way is to first fetch and do whatever changes you want to do, commits and all and at last once you are satisfied then merge it.

End Goal/result of both git fetch and git pull is same. 

### From this point onwards you can start working/contributing on other open source projects/repository on GitHub
### Forking a repository
Let's see How to fork a repository?
What deos mean by forking a repository?

So, If you want to contribute to any other project/open source.
- The first step is to fork a repository into your profile
  - How do we do that?
  - There is an option on top right **fork**
  - Create a new fork
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87ec16dc-0a6a-4920-9313-e69bc71a37c8)

- You will the whole repository come to your profile as well and also the path is highlighted from where you forked (actual repository)
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f3f537f-1362-4272-aafe-f89259b4a338)
  - If you will see any new commits or changes in that case you can fetch and upstream but as of now both your forked repo and the source from where you forked both are same
  - This is now your repository, you can now play around with it, you can do whatever you want to.
  - How can you do anything?
  - Clone this repository to your local git repository, We're taking this code from your profile forked repository not the original source Just for your reminder. So we're not downloading or cloning from Original source and will do all stuff.
     - copy repository HTTP URL
     - ```shell git clone <HTTP URL>```
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/add2d6b2-d1e8-49ba-bbdf-6288bcf3ee76)
