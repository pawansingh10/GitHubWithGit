## 1. Introduction to GitHub
We have already seen **Git**, Again we're discussing **GitHub**. Aren't they sound very similar?

It seems like Git and GitHub both are same thing But NOOOOOOOOOO!

Git and GitHub are completely two different thing. Although they support each other like two brothers.

So, Let's understand the difference between Git and GitHub.

- **Git VS GitHub**

  1. Git is a distributed VCS, VCS is a software that manages or keeps  track of files and folders in your project.
  2. Git is a most popular version control system. There are other VCS as well like Subversion, Mercurial etc etc.
  3. We use git bcuz it is a distributed Version control system.
  
> **Git** is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.

  4. GitHub is not a version control system. It is a website(Cloud based hosting website). Basically It is a service that allows you to host Git Repository .

> **GitHub** is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories
    
> If you want to work with opensource projects that use **Git**, then **GitHub** is designed to help you better manage them.
 
  5. If you have a project on Git and you want to take that project and upload somewhere on the cloud/server so that everyone can see all around the world. you can make that project as public. So what you do is take your Git project and upload it on GitHub.
  
  - So, GitHub is like social Networking Website for developer community like Facebook or LinkedIn where developers from all around the world can come and work on one project. Similar to facebook where users or friends they can chats, they can create a groups.

Let say If you want to create a mobile Application a machine learning app. or a machine learning app or a web app and you want that other collaborators/developers should also contribute to it. So what you can do is you can opensource this project or this software, whatever you are creating. And If you're using git as a version control then you can host that project on GitHub.

It's not that GitHub is only one platform, Similar to Git, we also have SVN, Mercurial, different-2 vcs.

Similar to GitHub we have other platform as well one is BitBucket, GitLab, Sourceforge, launchapd etc.

> **GitHub can be also used as a portfolio to show that you are an active developer**

Example - If you show that I have a lot of projects on my GitHub Repository then a lot of recruites actually visit your profile to see that your contribution in projects or opensource project.And Many recruiters hire developers from GitHub as well.

**Only developers can undersatnd HOW IMPORTANT GITHUB IS?**

**Git and GitHub, They both although sound same, they are support each other But they're not same exactly.**


Let's explore Git as a website.
1. Search in google [GitHub]

10. Basically you should explore all the sections out there!!

- **How to create a new repository/import repository/**, Simply left of your profile there will be + sign button
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ce68d23-3299-4b18-8e63-73b4d3c73ffb)

### How do we create Central Repository?
- Before that Let's understand **Why Central Repository is required?**
- Everyone knows in Git, there are 3 stages 1> Working Directory 2> Staging Area 3> Local Repo Commits, all these three things are on your local system.
  So suppose Developer 1 has its Git project on his local machine, similarly another Developer 2 has also his on Git Project on his local machine.
  If Developer 1 wants to work on a project on its own, only one person Developer 1, Then Developer 1 can use Git in his local System that's perfectly fine. Similar is true for Developer 2 also.

  But What if Developer 1 and Developer 2 and more n Developers wants to contribute or work on a single project.Then they need something called **Server or central Repository**.
  This Central repository will contain the final code that everyone can see, push or pull who is working on that project.
  So Developer 2 will see there are some changes over here on central repository then I need to pull the code.
  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b38ce7a4-03ad-4c51-9294-2f942f5f00ac)

 - Let's see **How do we create Central Repository?**
   1. Open GitHub Log in & you'll land on GitHub Home Page, there will be + sign button click you will see dropdown list there you will find New Repository option.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f54bda06-4800-4178-81c4-7968b18311b3)

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f768d52-f715-4a52-b53b-9fcb487009ee)


   2. As you create a New Repository, You will get a pop and option like this to create a new repository on the Command line
      ```shell
         echo "# GitHub101" >> README.md
         git init
         git add README.md
         git commit -m "first commit"
         git branch -M main
         git remote add origin git@github.com:pawansingh10/GitHub101.git
         git push -u origin main
      ```
     
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ce7e2db-e530-46d8-b19c-f3f673cc48a1)
  
      Creating README.md & Adding README.md to staging area
      Creating Main Branch as Master Slave Concept is now not recommendable for Git, So basically renaming it to Main Branch + Checking the Branch Details which we have created
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01dbd03f-82f8-4728-ab8e-b86a0b6efb51)
 
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20dcd502-28a9-47d4-b73b-fdb73ff45941)
  
      Setting GitHub Repository path to our Local Git
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8e344b4-a127-47ea-9336-d7c2670adf85)
  
      Setting URL of your GitHub Repository if permissed denied without https path.
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0873d312-04b5-49fd-af56-08962af61d30)

      Pushing you data from your local git repository to GitHub server main branch repository, for the first time
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae751282-2058-4715-8c25-ec9d87f231b1)

      Now you will see on your Git-GitHub Repository the README.md file will be uploaded into your repository

      Next Let's create one more file intro.txt but your intro save this on your local git repository
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c96986d-9d24-4ef0-b75a-25fc6b183ce3)

      Now pushing it to your Server GitHub Repository
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50b9d225-e171-4a39-abd1-3c95a055c7c6)

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bafd1c25-d506-481f-9a0e-f6d004077172)

- **Token Authentication Error**
Whever you have to push your code to the GitHub Repository or Central Repository. So you have to authenticate yourself that This is my User_ID and Password.
Once GitHub authenticate that you're a real user, then it allows you to push/pull or whatever you want to do on GitHub?
For Authentication there are 3 ways:-
1. **User_ID and Password**, Problem with User_ID and password is it's less secure.So Now GitHub does support this after 2021, instead they came with PAT
2. **PAT - Personal Access Token**, These are token based authentication
3. **SSH**, This is more secure

So Without TAP or SSH Authentication, You won't be able to push your code to GitHub, bcuz GitHud doesn't support User_ID, Password. 

### PAT Personal Access Token Authentication

Let's see **How do we Authentication with Personal Access Token?** or How to create the Personal Access Token?
- Open GitHub Account >> Got to Profile >> Setting >> Developer Setting >> Personal Access Token >> Generate a new Token
  You can write 1. Note as Demo or for what purpose, Put 2. Expiry Date - No Expiry 3. Select Scope - Repository blah blah So Create for Everything  >> Generate token 


  Once you have PAT, Setup it with Windows Credential Manager for that >> Control Panel > Search for Windows Credential > Search GitHub replace your password with PAToken.

  PAT works over the https, so if your repository is in https they you can use PAT.
  But you have created repository on SSH, in that case you have to use SSH Key

### SSH Authentication
  Lets see **SSH Key Authentication**
  SSH (Secure Shell Protocol) and they're more secure than PAT(HTTPS) and hhtps

  **Generate New SSH Key, and How to authenticate yourself with SSH Key?**
  [Click Here for Official Doc](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys)

  Generate New SSH Key
  ```shell
      ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
  ```
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b86ea38-271d-41cc-88bc-cdcfbddd80f6)

  It says generating public and private keys. There will be always Two keys 1> Private Key 2> Public Key when you work with SSH as there are different algorithms behind each key generated.
  The Private Key is always remain in your local computer or system.
  The Public Key, you will have to put on GitHub.
  There is no two way encryption like if someone get your Public Key, they will not be able to get private key from the public key

  > Whenever you try to authenticate or push your code to GitHub, Now you don't have to put the password this is why we are using SSH Key.
  > Whenever you do operation on GitHUb that require authentication the what Git and GitHub will do is they will check private key with public key of your GitHub account if they match they will authenticate you to do operation if it doesn't match It will fail to authenticate.That's why SSh Key is generate in Key-Pair.

  It is asking you for file name to store SSH Key, Simply type enter it will take that default file name which is mentioned there like **id_ed234xxxx**
  Again it will ask for pass phrase, if you don't want hit enter and move forward

  Your SSH is generate
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc51dce8-8757-4db0-960c-e2e883370516)

  Your Private and Public key is generate in the mentioned Hidden Folders
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92e13489-5709-4eed-9e89-83393b084902)

 Copy your public key which is having extension .pub open that in any editor and copy the key and Now we have to put that public key onto our GitHub Account
 Go to GitHub >> Profile >> Setting >> SSH and GPG Keys >> SSH Key >> New SSH Key >> Give Title like Demo and Paste key in Key section >> Add SSH Key

 Now your SSH Key has been added to your GitHub account now whenever you need to authenticate you just simply perform the operations
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4498f1df-baac-4e07-a999-246d972c9560)

If you want to check your SSH keys set properly or not, Try this out
```shell
   ssh -T git@github.com
```
☝️Use the above command to connect Git with GitHub Server, This will take your GitHub account and try to authenticate

This means your SSH Key is enables as you're seeing your username.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6af9345-1e67-4058-9463-cbf8ef60bf0d)

> Most of the time people use SSH to authenticate bcuz It is more secure but again that's fine you don't want to use SSH even if you use Personal Access Token that's okay But again after 2021 you can't use UserID and Password to authenticate.


[You can read more about the token Authentication Click Here](https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/)

[To remember the Personal Access token in your laptop for future authentication, follow the steps](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68775869/support-for-password-authentication-was-removed-please-use-a-personal-access-to)

[To read more about SSH Keys, read the Github official docs.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

### Uploading an existing Git Project on GitHub
- We have one project called MyPortfolio, We have seen how to create new repository on central server GitHub and also sink the repository with Git on local Machine.
- So we have alo to changes and commits to our local Git Repository
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3ed4e39-800e-411d-874e-fa79db2c267b)

- Now we want to keep this project as it is and want to push this project / these codes and with all commits which are being made on the central Repository GitHub the How can we do this?

  Step 1. Create a new Repository on GitHub with name MyPortfolio it is not neccessarily same as local repository, Description can be My Personal Website, keep it as public, Create Repository
          Then you will see another option push an existing repository from command line
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cf44dbe-754b-42ee-8ded-57bb742ec8d7)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03a2f666-cf89-4f35-887f-63e45c1abdb8)

  Step 2. The only thing we have to do is add the remote of this GitHub server repository by using command
          If you check Remote, So there is no remote
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/caadeccd-7fff-452d-8881-98e953fbf9d2)

  So let's add the remote 
  ```shell
          git remote add origin https://github.com/pawansingh10/MyPortfolio.git
          git branch -M main
          git push -u origin main
  ```
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9753bf60-de2a-424d-a8a7-d323a80c97ce)

  After this if you want to rename your master branch to main write the command then you can do if you wish other let it be
  Now you have to push your master branch to GitHub repository which is central repository.

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/799e378a-dbfe-4c3b-a9b9-ebccf519d104)
        
   ☝️ It has created a new branch master from local git master branch  to the master of GitHub Repository
       All files and folders transfer is done and there in link given you can check there
       So refresh you GitHub repository you will see all files and folder there.

   So if you share this url to anyone they can see your files and folder.

  You can check all the commits you have been made since the starting from your local git.

  Here, you're not seeing **README.md** file. It tells to viewers that This Project is all about this........Documentation.
  So Let's add README.md file and push it to GitHub repository
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cdb945a-ae35-43a6-bfad-fed9178d1e21)

**Summary - This is how create a project on GitHub, with new project or already existing git project**

### Working with Remotes
Let's see What is Remote?
Remote in Git or GitHub is exactly like a remote of a TV/AC/Device. What actually remote does is Control comething from a different location.
That's why we added ```bash git remote add origin <url of project>``` which means -
To check How many remotes are available ```bash git remote ``` you will see only one which is origin
So here **Origin** is a remote name, by suing this remote you can push and pull to any particular repository

For see details about remote ```bash git remote -v```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/810d449c-297d-4f6c-98de-5f8505b64fed)

☝️ You'll see two links one is for fetch which means this link can be use to fetch the files and folder from GitHub to your local Git repository
   another one is for push which means this link can be use to push the files and folder from your local Git repository to Central GitHub repository
   So One remote can be use to push something and fetch something at the same time

But what if I don't want to name it as origin? can We add one more remote? Yes We can. for that instead of origin keep you remote name as myremote
```shell git remote add myremote <url https://github.com/abc10>```

So Let's add one remote

```shell git add remote myremote <url project repo link>```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0f28afe-6d91-4600-9657-8ccff80890d2)

If we have to push something last time what we did was ```shell git push -u origin master``` , Here -u was to say this is a upstream.

We have 2 ways to push/fetch our code to Central GitHub repository through you remote one through origin another through myremote it doesn't matter

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83b1338a-a365-4b6e-a32a-6a5d66ef568f)

### Cloning a GitHub Repository
- Here, We will see How to clone any GitHub Repository

- So first go to the your GitHub Home Page, Search for the Repository you want to clone in search bar.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5099112c-bbe8-4fc7-b454-24db6e8420ee)

- Click on that project/repo, you will get two options either you can download a zip file in GUI way or by copy the http link of the repo through command line.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/402445a1-41ac-465d-9705-59859ae7734f)

- Obviously we will do it by Git Bash Command line, first move to your folder where you want to clone/download then run the cmd ```shell git clone <url of GitHUb Repository>```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f87c7252-c9f5-446c-81e5-1ab9f021bc6e)

- Now you can make changes in the file and play around these make commits and all but all on your local Git Repository.
- If you want to make changes or contribute to the other you can't do it here. We will see that in next section.
**Summary, We have seen how to clone a repository**

So We're done with GitHub basics, we will see advance topic in next section

## 2. Social Coding with GitHub

Here in this section, we will deep dive into GitHub, 
- How can we collaborate with other developer's projects?
- How can we create a network of developers?
- other features related to GitHub

### Fetching Changes from GitHub
How do you take changes, whatever the changes that has been done or uploaded by other developers in any project/repository/code?
So How can we download those changes?
One thing we can do is clone the repository again and again but a repository every time will download the complete repository.
So Here we can do that by **git fetch**

The ```shell git fetch``` command downloads commits, files and refs from a remote repository into your loca repo
Although if you have different branches on GitHub so you can specify from which branch you want to take changes ```shell git fetch <remote> <branch>```

So ```shell git fetch``` can take those changes from GitHub Server repository to your local repository not in working Directory or staging area.
There is one more command after **git fetch** that we have to do to take those changes and to reflect it in our local working directory ```shell git ```

So Let say if some other developer is contributing to your project and he added a new file newdeveloper.html there and you  want to fetch the file into local Git Repository
Now I want to keep my local git repository up to date as a synchronisation.

So If you check what are your remotes, remotes are like this local repository is connected with a central GitHub repository with a remote.
```shell git remote -v ```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a61166a-3429-46e4-8e0f-050d7abbcb3e)

We have 2 remotes origin and myremote both are referencing or pointing to the same central repository which is our GitHub Repository. So we can use any of them.

Now, ```shell git fetch ``` will be fine if you have only one branch which is in this case that is master branch But if you have multiple branches over there on your central repository in that case you have to specify from which branch and by which remote you want to fetch ```shell git fetch origin master```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/772c51c8-5077-41f1-a0bd-1d173569cc17) ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a7edec5-a8d8-4d36-a4ed-de398e8904b7)

So the last commit from Central GitHub Server Repository  master branch has been downloaded to your local git repository, but you will not see that commit into your local git working directory that's bcuz git fetch only do chnages from central server to local git repository there is one more step if you want to see the changes into your local working directory is ```shell git merge <remote><branch>```.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/175dc7bb-316a-4fcc-8347-cdb2243aafb1)

If you want to delete the extra remote which you had created then write command ```shell git remote remove <remote_name>```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6306ba64-9b26-414a-b85f-177d090dc66d)

### Pulling changes from GitHub
Similar to ```shell git fetch``` there is also a commad called ```shell git pull``` 
Que : What's the difference between ```shell git fetch``` and ```shell git pull```?
Ans - To overcome the two commands ```shell git fetch origin master``` and  ```shell git merge <remote><branch>```, git pull found helpful in just one command ```shell git pull```
     git pull takes changes from central server repository to directy local git working directory. 

> **git pull = git fetch + git merge**
> There is disadvantage also.

Now suppose another developer added files to central github repository and made commits now you want to pull it So lets see how we can do it by git pull instead of git fetch like last time

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a010c431-73bf-473c-9c66-76cb30defdf9)

One Question will arise, Out of git fetch and git pull which one should be preferred?
It's up you, if you're working on alone no other collaborator then you can use git pull but some time if you use git pull there can be issue of merge conflicts(when the same file is changed by two different branch/developers and they try to merge them)
So safer way is to first fetch and do whatever changes you want to do, commits and all and at last once you are satisfied then merge it.

End Goal/result of both git fetch and git pull is same. 

### From this point onwards you can start working/contributing on other open source projects/repository on GitHub
### Forking a repository
Let's see How to fork a repository?
What deos mean by forking a repository?

So, If you want to contribute to any other project/open source.
- The first step is to fork a repository into your profile
  - How do we do that?
  - There is an option on top right **fork**
  - Create a new fork

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87ec16dc-0a6a-4920-9313-e69bc71a37c8)

- You will the whole repository come to your profile as well and also the path is highlighted from where you forked (actual repository)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f3f537f-1362-4272-aafe-f89259b4a338)

  - If you will see any new commits or changes in that case you can fetch and upstream but as of now both your forked repo and the source from where you forked both are same
  - This is now your repository, you can now play around with it, you can do whatever you want to.
  - How can you do anything?
  - Clone this repository to your local git repository, We're taking this code from your profile forked repository not the original source Just for your reminder. So we're not downloading or cloning from Original source and will do all stuff.
     - copy repository HTTP URL
     - ``` git clone <HTTP URL>```
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/add2d6b2-d1e8-49ba-bbdf-6288bcf3ee76)


### Making a Pull Request
Pull Request is one of the brilliant idea in GitHub. With Pull request, you can contribute to someone else's code.
You can say that - Hey I have made some modification on your code or written a new file or created a feature or fixed a bug and i'm sending you a pull request.So please pull the code that I have written.Bcuz you can't push the code to someone else central GitHub Repository. 

Why is it not call push request, why is it called as pull request?
This because you're asking the other person to pull your code that you have written.

Let's see How to create a pull request?
Create a New folder Searching write a python file linearSearch.py under you PythonForked repository
Add the file to your local git repository
Commit it to your local git repository
push it to your GitHub Central repository

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b856357-dcc3-4235-9ca5-1bddba0289d5)


Then from your GitHub Home page create a pull request to original source from where you forked the Repository.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bc3e720-e2e4-4218-a7a1-fd04655b58cb)

### Merging a Pull Request
Let's see "How we merge Pull Request?"
By the way Merging Pull Request is not in your hand.If you're not the owner/maintainer of the project.
Example - Tensorflow Project or Repository, You don't own that repository. So you can't merge the pull request. You can just create a pull request, the maintainer of the project will merge if they find that your pull request makes some sense and you have done a good job like created a feature or fixed some bug.

So, Let's see this as if you're a maintainer of the project and someone sent you a pull request Now you have to merge it.
- In this case, you will see pull request notification in Pull request tabb of your Project/Repository page
- Click see there who sent you request, what changes are being made, is it make sense? or you want modification then based upon that leave a comment on the pull request
- The person who send you this Pull request will get notified about your comment.
- He might be modify the changes, add it and made another commit then push it to his profile GitHub repository from there again he will open the pull request
- Now Maintainer of the project will see the Pull Request and once they satisfied they will merge it with another commit with comments 
- Now the maintainer will not see any open pull request and the changes has been added to the main project and all the commits will be there.

> This is How we open a pull request? and How do we merge the Pull request?
> By the way if you're a contributor to any project so don't worry!

### GitHub Issues
So there are something know as **Issues** in GitHub.
Again Suppose you're a maintainer of the Project and developers and contributors are contributing to your project.
Inside your project/repository you can see sections like <>code,▫️**Issues**, Pull requests, Actions, Projects, Insights, Settings sections
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2386a382-f4e0-4e15-a9c8-2961c35d0276)

As a maintainer of the project you will see the **Issues** section, Generally what maintainer do in issue section is Create Issue of Project for people who want to contribute can see the issue and know what are the issues on this project and then contribute. 
For Example - If there is a bug, If you're a project manager you know there is a bug/issue and if you want to fix this you can write it in Issue section if any contributor come in and see the bug and they fix it.

So, Issues are like topic.

So as a maintainer of the project let's create a new issue
- Go to Issue Section >> New Issue >> Title it as "create an Algorithm" and If you want write description, "Create a folder & Write all seaching and sorting alogorithms in c++ and send PR" and lebel it accordingly like "good first issue" or "bug" etc.

Now a new developer come to your repository, what he will do is He will see that there is one issue that is available in this repository and also label as good first issue that means it's for beginners and also he will read the description and he will get to know what he has to do.
- He will forked the repository to his GitHub account from there he will clone that repository to his Local Machine Git repository He will make the changes add those changes and make commits and then push it to his GitHub repository and from there He will create a pull request and that request will go to the original source repository from the repository was forked and the maintainer of the repositoy will see in his project there is a Pull Request and then will see  who created this pull request what changes are being made does it make sense if yes owner will merge the pull request with a commit and message.
- Now maintainer of the project will close the Issue with Comment as it is solved!!.
- Like this new bug new issue will open and close and the cycle will continue.

> **Why Issues are there? How it is integrated with Pull Request? Pull Request - sending a pull request, opening a pull reqeuest, Creating an Issue** is how you contribute to any open source software.
> If you do all these things that means you're contributing to a open source software.


### Sync git and GitHub Repo with Upstream
Let's again suppose you're a owner/maintainer of a project. Developer A comes to your repository and sees there is an issue and this is for beginner So he reads the description and all. And Now he wants to contribute So He forked the repository, clone it to local git and made changes and commits and push the code to his Github forked repository and Created a Pull request now Maintainer of the Original Project accepts his pull request and merged it with commit and now new file is being added to the main project.

But but but What If Owner/maintainer added one file to the original repository or let say another contributor added a file to original repository. Then As a contributor you will be 2 or 3 commits behind the original source repository. Now as a individual developer you want to same code which is being recently committed in original source repository into your forked repository. So How do you that? 
- Basically as a developer you want Synchronization of the forked repository with the Upstream which is original source repository.
   - So You can do this by going to the section **fetch upstream** >> fetch and merged
   - Now your forked branch is sync with the original source repository with same commits.
> This is how we sync our forked repository with upstream i.e the Original source repository.

- If you go to your local git repository, and you check the ``` git status ``` It will shows you are up to date, up to date with your forked repository not with the original source repository
  - This is bcuz you have only remote for your Forked GitHub repository not the original source repository
  - ``` git remote -v```
  - So You can add the remote for original Source Repository from where you forked the repository, So How do we do that?
     - Simply Go to Original Source Repository  >> Go to the Code >> Copy the HTTPS URL Link ``` git remote add <upstream_remote> <Original Source Repo URL>```
     - Now you will have two remotes one is origin and another is upstream_remote But here in upstream_remote you will only have permission to fetch not to push bcuz you're not the owner of the original Sorce repository
     -  So Now you want to fetch/pull from original Souce repo, you can use the remote upstream_remote and then pull it from there ``` git pull upstream_remote <Original Source Repo URL>```
     -  Now all the files and folders will be downloaded and you will see them in your local git repository
     -  And If you check the log ``` git log --oneline``` you will all the commits


### GitHub Pages
It is an interesting idea or concept where you can actually Host your HTML/CSS/JS like the whole website.
So If you have a static website that doesn't have a backend like NodeJS or Django

Even if you have a dynamic website based on JavaScript like if you have only FrontEnd and you want o host it may be somewhere, then GitHub is one of the best platform to host your website like your Portfolio type of Website.

So Let's understand **How do we create GitHub Pages**
- Setting >> Pages >> Select Branch as master >> /root and Save them after few seconds you will get your website link.

## Miscellaneous Git Tools
So far we have covered lot of Git Tools, Git Commands  that we use to our day to day very frequently used in project.
But Here We will see some **Miscellaneous Git Commands, Miscellaneous Git Tools** that sometime you use for some additional benefits that Git provides to you.

### Display the changes in a commit
``` git show <commit_id>```

☝️ You can actually look what changes you have amde in any specific commit.

How would you know the long (40 Char SSH Key ID) commit_id, So don't worry you only have to put first 4 character of your commit_id 

By the way GitHub gives you this feature in GUI format. Click on any commit >> You can see what file has been changed added modified deleted etc

So If you want to see details of your specific commit the taken commit id 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2946bd3d-531e-45b6-94d7-4072d425c3fb)

### Stashing
Let's see Stashing, **Stashing** is a concept in git. What is Stashing? Why do we use Stashing?
So sometime it happens let say you're working on a new feature called cool feature.So you're working on this feature, creating files and folders modifying it in a meantime your boss manager calls and says you have to immediately work on a bug that happened/occured in a Home page of our website.So Now you have to fix very very import bug in Home Page of your website.

So right now you're in a situation if you go back to different branch then you loose your work of the feature that you're currently working on cool.html bcuz it is not completed you also don't want to commit it.

One way is that you can commit whatever you have done in your feature cool working on then come to home.html and start fixing the bug immediatly once it is done again you go to your feature cool from where you commited and start working on that. BUT but but This way will create unnecessary commits time and again and you will be ended up with lots of commits which makes your history very vague or irrelevant.
So you don't want to commit those changes right now bcuz the task is not done yet. So here **Stashing** come into picture, So what stashing will do is It takes the dirty stage or the dirty area of your working directory like your newly added files or files in staging area or untracked files that are modified  or unfinished changes etc and Stashing store it in a format of stack somewhere in stack memory. You don't have to commit this. Now without worrying about loosing the changes you can go back to Home.html work there fix the bug come back and start working on your feature cool.html

> **Sometime you don't want to commit changes and you want to move to different branch but moving to different branch is not possible if your working directory is not clean, your branch is not clean** So Stashing helps you there. This is why Stashing is required.

> **Stashing takes the dirty state of your working directory i.e. (your modified tracked files and staged changes) and saves it on a slack of unfinished changes that you can re-apply at any time**
```shell
    git stash
    #OR
    git stash apply
    #OR
    hit stash save
    ## all of them are same only   
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45f0c780-9b33-4347-9e7d-c50b826ff4f2)

Once you git stash, you can move to different branch and go work there without worrying about your feature cool bcuz it is already stashed.
It says Saved Working directory.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c310d6df-e6e0-4213-86d2-8e3d854acac8)

Here Now we're working on imediately on urgent fixed in main branch Home.html

Now we will see How we will apply slashing to get back to our feature branch cool.html and start working on it

### Apply Slashing
Let's see How do we go back to the cool branch and get the same file.
You can create multiple stashes and also stash uses gi diff internally.

To see all stashes that you created use command ``` git stash list```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4792888-702f-4481-806b-2ce66a3fc004)

To get back the stash you want use command ``` git stash apply <stash name>```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0457760-f787-4b2a-8e2b-436d4b8635f5)

Now meanwhike you're working you again get urgent task. So you can create another stash 
So check the how many stashes are there? ``` git stash list``` you'll have only one stash@{0} and you need the new stash so you can delete this stash ``` git stash drop stash@{0}```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36cfa813-31c6-4f45-8298-8cfc8b269d13)

Now You want to create another one ``` git stash ```

Sometime It becomes important that you're working on a feature and you have to move to a different branch So you can stash those changes & it will be stored in stack.

### Cleaning Working Repository
So Another Solution for the problem of dirty Working directory is - Just clean your working directory ``` git clean``` delete the every change that you made after that particular commit.

- **You may not want to stash some work or files in your working directory, but simply get rid of them; that's what the git clean command is for**
``` git clean -f -d``` -f & -d stands for forcefully deleting all the directory

But we can simply delete the file, why this **git clean** command is there?
If you have create/made/change one file you can manually delete that. But by any chance if you created/changed/madified different-2 lots of file and you don't remember what changes you have made in which files then you can't delete those changes manually and still you want to clean your working directory. You want to go back to the last commits which you made. So How can we do this is ``` git clean -f -d```

Now Suppose you created a dummy.html in your cool_branch and in meantime you got a call to work on main branch. So You have to jump to main branch but you don't want to stash your changes in cool_branch neither you want to commit. So what you can do is - clean your working directory ```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d16fbf6e-1775-42b7-9baf-646df2607b98)

## Rewriting History

### Changing the Last Commit
History is like commits or past versions that you made in the process of building your entire project.

So this topic is known as **Re-Writing History** which means changing the commits which basically means either you want to change some files or change messages or you want to create a branch from your any previous commit. So what we can do is Go back to the history and that's the whole purpose of Git bcuz we have saved everything in these versions/commits. So we can easily rollback to the previous commits.

The whole idea of git is to provide this funtionality

Most often funtionality or use case of re-writing history is How do you change the last commit that you made?
And this is most often or many times happens. Why this happens? let's say you made a commit and then you realized by mistake, I have added a file that I don't want to add or may be I have not added the file that I actually wanted to add or I have made a typo in the message. So the last commit is the most often modified by the developers.

So, Let's understand How to modify the last commit that you just made?
For Example in our case manager told us to fix a bug in Home.html master branch. So If you look at the history/commit/version ``` git log --oneline```
So last commit was Very important fixed in Home.html but that was not a fixed actually I had just added a line of code. ypu can check ``` git show <commit_id>``` 
So wrote a wrong message over there on last commit and Now I want to rename/rewrite/change that message. This happens most often many a time.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/393d4c12-875f-42f6-a1a5-0498c06fb276)

Changing the message of the last commit
``` git commit --amend```
What it will do is open a text editor **Vim Text Editor** This we have already used when we got Merge Conflict.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/196c16bf-7811-420f-9983-9354e56642d1)

What you can do is :- esc + i to write on Vim Text editor and the esc + : wq hit enter
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18c70f36-153d-430e-b29f-67cb66716431)

So This is like a most important tool that you should know How to change the last commit you have made.bcuz most often you made mistake in last commit.

### Changing the Last Commit
Let's see How do we make the actual change in the last commit which we made.

If i wanted to add more file or wanted to more modification in same commit which was my last commit then How can I do that?
Here idea will remain same command will remain same.
``` git commit --amend```
- Changing the actual content of the last commit.
  - Step 1. Make changes in the working directory
  - Step 2. Add files to the satging area
  - Step 3. Instead of writing new commit we will Run the same command **git commit --amend**

Let say instead of just changing the last commit message what I want is to change the content or make modification the file Home.html and that too in the same last commit.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb5323b7-a70b-41b2-811d-5f3f51c8254d)

Again It will ask me Information of what commit message do you want to give? you want to change the commit message do it otherwise skip it esc + : + wq hit enter.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/facbed98-a3ed-40b1-9098-2fdf77dc06d5)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9f53683-720f-412b-a02a-63f04073f473)

Similarly if you want to delete, modify, add a new line etc you can do in the same last commit.

It is not necessarily that you can change only last commit you can change last 3 commits as well.

### Checkout Commit
Now, Let's see How do we go back to the past any commit that we want?

- We can travel the time to go in the past to any specific commits
  ``` git checkout <commit_id>```

Earlier We have used **checkout** to go from one branch to another branch. So checkout is not only for the branches, it can be used at different-2 places. basically checkout simply means I want to go there.

Suppose You want to go to a specific version which is one of the initial commit and why I want to go there bcuz inside that commit there is a folder and there I created a very important file/code. Since I don't have this abc folder I want to go back this commit and I want to understand what all files we had.And i want to take one important file out and use this file as my new feature or use the code written inside.

So Let's do it :-
1. Check your project history/commits/versions ``` git log --oneline```
2. Pick and copy the commit_id from where you want to go
3. Do ``` git checkout <commit_id>```

A lot of files and folders after that specific commit will be deleted  from your local git repository.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f3f26d8-b10e-46f1-bf13-572149cffa6f)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b4882fc-806b-474b-9e0f-f5d0175940d4)

But Why I back to this same commit bcuz I wanted to go back same commit and wanted to see what's inside the folder which is imp for me blah blah blah...
Now Let's see the message we got after traveling to the specific commit

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9c83359-6073-4aef-b887-4bb1d7eb0ba5)

It clearly says that We're not in master so what actually happened. HEAD detached!!
We have lots of commits and master will always at last commit and most of the time head also moves with branch. But here what happened actually is we detached the HEAD and took this HEAD from last commit to that specific commit_ID.
Now If you want to make some changes or build a feature from this moment/commit. Let's create a new branch from there nobody stops you. Go ahead.
And again you can come back to master branch also. We will see How? ``` git switch -``` It will take you to master by moving HEAD from current specific commit_ID to master branch last commit.

4. To Return back to Master branch last commit Do  ``` git switch -```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53e8e30a-6267-4e28-82b7-0e437d60a1be)

### Making new branch from the old commit

1. So first check the branches available ```git branch -v```
2. Then check the log ```git log --oneline```
3. Go Back to the specific old commit from where you want to create a new branch for that copy Commit_ID
4. Move to that commit_ID ```git checkout <commit_ID>``` Now you're on a specific commit which you want which is different from your master branch last commit.
5. Now suppose you're making the changes in the file added it and committed it and you're doing same and added another commit.
6. Now If you want to move to the master branch where your HEAD was, by writing ```git swtich -``` then what git will say is - You made some commits to this branch by coming to this specific commit and Now If you do not save them in a different branch then I will delete them but if you create different branch then you can come back to any branch to this and start working on that branch. It's so easy.
7. So, To create a new branch we use this command ```git switch -c <branch_name>``` and the commits you made will go into this branch. But this history branch will not be created from the master branch rather it is created from the specific commit point.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2a4102a-be2e-4d76-aabe-1bf4fc6ec24c)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaf4867d-0cc8-4754-99f2-45b54c94aaab)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d1e7025-aec7-455c-bfb9-383053e97390)

> Isn't this magical? This is whole crux of Git. For this purpose only we use git.
> Now you know, you can go back to the anywhere in the time and can change or modify or create file or create a new branch from any specific commit.

8. Now If you want to keep this feature pause and want to come back to master branch let's do that ```git checkout master```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a3538b2-76ae-400a-b9d1-3bed2791c603)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5df4deef-e921-4029-8bcb-ca58784a851b)


### Revert Commit
Here, We will see few DANGEROUS 💀 commands! You need to be very cautious while using them.

1. How do you Revert any commit?
Once you have made a commit and it has shown its behavior or nature you want to undo it.
For that purpose we use revert, By the way we can't delete any commit.
Example- If you added one line and commited then  in revert what we will do is delete that line but It appears that we have deleted that commit but eventually you're not deleting.

Let's see How do we revert a commit?
You can undo the changes of any commit that you want.
``` git revert <commit_ID>```

Since these commands are slightly dangerous, they can may be result into merge conflict or loss of the code
Be cautious, so first switch from master branch to new branch ```git checkout cool_branch```
see the difference in the file
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaa07747-ae98-4ce4-bc90-b6acedbe8cc7)

Now Revert ```git revert <commit_ID>```, Again Vim Text Editor will be open and will ask to change the default commit message, if you want change it  press esc + i and then change or else keep as it is esc + : + wq
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac97d22d-4fd4-42ce-a602-a372c5c35839)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7aba1d02-5482-4a29-a74e-df00e01187a3)

So this was your Home.html before it was changed Heading by B1.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c04002de-18ca-4808-a496-ddc4f9c76539)


> **If you have created a commit, deletion of that commit is not possible but you can go and revert the modification/changes which was done by that commit**

Note :- When you do ```git revert <commit_id>``` it actually created a new commit, It changes/modify the file, added into the staging area and created a commit with the message.
But What you can also do is - You can ask git to give me those changes like Undo only changes but don't commit it, I will commit on my own whener I want. So if you explicitly want to commit the rever, then you cam also do just simply provide -n flag ```git revert -n <commit_id>``` Now you don't have to undo the changes and commit at the same time. Now you can undo the changes and do you more changes if you want like add more file, delete more code lines and then you can commit by git add . git commit revert changes. It's up to you.

Let's see this
Go to the cool_branch then look for any specific commit which you want to revert see the difference
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0554dacc-ed66-436e-b1d3-697e547f55c4)

As we run the command immediately It will delete the file, and now branch is dirty as it doesn't committed the changes 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/addd17a3-5f10-49b2-ab0e-e03f52e65f17)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9c113e4-9732-44e8-b978-304c390c9c50)
 You can now modify/add/delete the files and then you can add and commit it exlicitly.

 Now You still have an option to revert by writing ```git revert --abort```
 Suppose you don't want to these revert then you can do that as well
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29be4bc4-2c7c-4565-a8d5-26e4483508f3)


### Reset Commit
This is the most dangerous command of Git.

How this reset command is very very dangerous for us?

"DO NOT USE THE RESET COMMIT COMMAND IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES"

Let's understand what will happen in reset command?
We know from last lectures that deleting the commit is not possible but that's not true. You can delete the commit from the Top but not from in between.
Like you want to delete last commit, Yes you can.
If you want to delete last 3 commits, Yes you can.

So, How to delete the Top Commits?
The command will be -  
- **Very dangerous command**
    - delete all the commits from the given commit_id onwards

    ```shell
       git reset --soft <commit_id>
       git reset --hard <commit_id>
    ```
    - Here --soft flag is by default so even if you write ```git reset <commit_id>``` It's same. But if you want --hard flag then you have to put it explicitly.
Since It is dangerous branch so change your branch from master branch to cool_branch
Check git log for top commits
Let say your manager told you, you don't need these recent commits till this specific commit
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8938b9eb-b8be-4672-87d0-18137a5d3f31)

Now you will see after that specific commit_id all the commits are deleted. By the way the branch is dirty this is because when you use --soft flag, Here --soft flag gives you an option still you have chance if you want to get those commits file back still those files are in untrack status, if you check the git status
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc8a32bf-e8f5-4f3d-99e7-efb3058b39cb)
If you still want those files and  don't want to delete then stage them into staging area by git add . then git commit -m " "

If yo want to delete those files simple clean it ```git clean -f -d``` All files are gone forever now. Now you can't get those changes.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca295ea9-c961-4487-a0b3-8a6cec5f145e)


But what about --hard flag,  hard flag will not give you any second chance. As soon as you execute the command it will directly delete those files for forever.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/126ac2e3-28ca-4ced-8264-09a296f0277c)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea25915d-4a75-4f4b-abd9-2a86b50b3a38)

### Deleting Commits from GitHub
Here, We are learning, if we want to delete a silly commits from GitHub So how can you do that?

So First we go to the master branch check everything in our local git repository is in sync with our central GitHub repository.
If Yes then fine modify a file with silly mistakes If Not first sync that  for that we have remote 'origin' so now git pull/fetch git pull origin master from the GitHub Repository.
So now Vim Editor open asking for Commit message so keep this as it is esc + : + wq hit enter
Now all the changes are merged and auto reflected to our local git repository 
If you check git status It's clean
Now made some very silly comment as we have to delete it.
Now add and commit it git commit -a -m "silly commit"
Push this to GitHub git push origin master
Now If you check your GitHub repository all those commits re pushed to your master branch
So obviously we don't want that silly commit.
Now Delete that last commit

### Cherry-Picking Commits
Let's see about a command or concept of cherry-picking.
What is cherry-picking commit?
Let say if you have multiple branches, master branch and other branches

Pick the changes from a specific commit from any branch and merge with another branch.
```git cherry-pick <commit_id>```

Let's see that - For example suppose you want the changes from history_branch specific commit to master branch
1. Go to the history branch pick that commit id which you want to merge into master branch
